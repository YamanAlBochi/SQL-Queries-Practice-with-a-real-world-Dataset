# SQL-Queries-Practice-with-a-real-world-Dataset
In this Project, I'll write SQL Queries using a real dataset downloaded from the internet. The dataset is from Kaggle and will be used to write SQL Queries to fetch different information from the dataset..........

Understanding the underlying data stored across different tables will make it much easier to write SQL queries. And that is why I will use real data (real dataset) to write SQL queries in this Project.

First I load this dataset into a SQLite database. Meaning we store this data into database tables. Once the data is stored in tables, I then write SQL queries to fetch different information about the history of Olympic games.

(I have come up with 20 different SQL queries which we can write on this Olympics dataset below) : 

1- How many olympics games have been held?

2- List down all Olympics games held so far.

3- Mention the total no of nations who participated in each olympics game?

4- Which year saw the highest and lowest no of countries participating in olympics?

5- Which nation has participated in all of the olympic games?

6- Identify the sport which was played in all summer olympics.

7- Which Sports were just played only once in the olympics?

8- Fetch the total no of sports played in each olympic games.

9- Fetch details of the oldest athletes to win a gold medal.

10- Find the Ratio of male and female athletes participated in all olympic games.

11- Fetch the top 5 athletes who have won the most gold medals.

12- Fetch the top 5 athletes who have won the most medals (gold/silver/bronze).

13- Fetch the top 5 most successful countries in olympics. Success is defined by no of medals won.

14- List down total gold, silver and broze medals won by each country.

15- List down total gold, silver and broze medals won by each country corresponding to each olympic games.

16- Identify which country won the most gold, most silver and most bronze medals in each olympic games.

17- Identify which country won the most gold, most silver, most bronze medals and the most medals in each olympic games.

18- Which countries have never won gold medal but have won silver/bronze medals?

19- In which Sport/event, India has won highest medals.

20- Break down all olympic games where india won medal for Hockey and how many medals in each olympic games.
